# System Description

The purpose of this project is to create a hand gesture recognition library that is able to conduct a task once a hand gesture is recognized. The goal is to apply this to automobiles, where a driverâ€™s hand gesture will trigger the activation/modification of a car feature (ex. turning on/off the wipers, changing the music track, etc.) to reduce distractiosn while driving. The design will also achieve gesture recongition in lower lighting conditions, simplify the gestures required to activate functions and improve the overall accuracy of the gesture recongnition.


# Hardware Design
The Design uses the Intel Realsense L515 for RGB, IR, and Depth Camera capabilties.
Requirements:
1. Preferable - Intel Realsense L515 Camera
    a. USB 3.0 Connection
3. ELP Camera - https://a.co/d/7y2CkFu


# Software Design

We use a MediaPipe and Tensor Flow package referred in the resource section to track hands and their finger positions like the image below:

Figure 1. Hands Package Results

Using the data from the fingertip positions we generated a gesture and hand sign library and mapped them to different car intrisic features:
The following are the features that can be changed within the vehicle with the current library:
1. Change Modes
2. Volume/Temp Change
3. Next/Previous Track
4. Pause/Play Media
5. Answer Incoming Calls
